How to Use This Dataset for Testing

Seed the system:
POST each object one by one to /api/v1/events
Or bulk POST an array to /api/v1/events/bulk

Expected pipeline results (what your engine should generate after processing):
Signals emitted:
environment domain from air_quality_tick (high magnitude if PM2.5 > 50)
transport domain from traffic_event (magnitude based on congestion)
sentiment domain from social_post & user_report
health domain from health_aggregate

Hypotheses likely to appear:JSON{
  "description": "Elevated PM2.5 in Dehiwala correlated with severe traffic congestion and multiple citizen reports of respiratory irritation",
  "confidence": 0.79,
  "supporting_signals_count": 5,
  "domains": ["environment", "transport", "sentiment", "health"],
  "key_entities": ["Dehiwala", "PM2.5", "Traffic Congestion", "Respiratory Irritation"]
}

RAG query test cases (POST to /api/v1/rag/query):JSON{ "query": "Where is the worst air pollution right now in Colombo?" }
→ Should return something like: "Dehiwala shows highest PM2.5 (AQI 138) with strong correlations to traffic and citizen complaints."

{ "query": "Is there any sign of pollution affecting health today?" }
→ "Yes, moderate confidence link between elevated PM2.5 in southern Colombo and above-average respiratory reports."

{ "query": "Which area has the best air quality currently?" }
→ "Colombo Fort currently lowest PM2.5 (AQI ~78) with fewer negative signals."

Bonus: Quick Mock Response Examples
These are what your endpoints should return after ingesting the above data.

You can copy-paste these JSON objects directly into Postman / curl / your frontend fetch calls to test. This dataset is small enough to run quickly but rich enough to trigger meaningful correlations, decay, cross-domain boosts, and RAG responses.
